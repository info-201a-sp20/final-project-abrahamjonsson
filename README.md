**1. Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

Our domain is Popular Movies and Films. We chose this field because of our group's high interest in movies.

Popular movies are a huge part of the current generationâ€™s culture and exploring this topic more in depth
will help us understand how contemporary culture appeals to society.

**3.How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

_Example 1:_ There are 6820 observations (rows).

_Example 2:_ There are 9672 observations (rows).

_Example 3:_ There are 10,000 observations (rows).

_Example 4:_ There are 45466 observations (rows).

**4.How many features (columns) are in the data?**

_Example 1:_ There are 15 features (columns).

_Example 2:_ There are 7 features (columns).

_Example 3:_ There are 11 features (columns).

_Example 4:_ There are 24 features (columns).

**5.What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

_Example 1:_ The data in this dataset can help answer the question:
> "Do specific genres in the movie industry have an effect on the budget used to produce the film?""

_Example 2:_ The data in this dataset can help answer the question:
> "Does the orginal language affect how popular a film can be ?"

_Example 3:_ The data in this dataset can be used to answer the question:

This question can be answered by grouping the data rows by the release years and taking average of the
revenues/scores to then analyze and compare them to on another.

This can be done by arranging the movies by year, and comparing the revenues for each year.
